Hanging --- John Flavin

Finds the possible words given some sequence of letters according to the rules of Hanging with Friends.

USAGE
On the command line, type 'python hanging.py [arg1] [optional arg2]'
arg1 and arg2 will be different depending on whether you are guessing a word or making a word for your opponent.

CASE 1: GUESSING A WORD
arg1: The string you're trying to guess. Example below.
arg2: Letters you have already guessed which are wrong. Separated by spaces

Program finds all the possible words, tells you which letter(s) is (are) in the most words, and prints all the possible words (if there are fewer than 200).

EXAMPLE: 
Say I send you the word 'BUTT'. The game will spot you the 'U'. 
You type in 'python hanging.py .u..'
The program tells you that the letter in the most words is 'S'. 
You guess that in the game; it is wrong. 
You type in 'python hanging.py .u.. s'
The program tells you that the letter in the most words is 'R'. 
You guess that in the game; it is wrong.
You type 'python hanging.py .u.. s r'
Now there are two most common letters: 'L' and 'N'. 
You choose to try 'N'. It is wrong. 
Then you try 'L'. Also wrong. (It turns out that 'BUTT' is a pretty good word.)
You type 'python hanging.py .u.. s r n l'
The program tells you that the letter in the most words is 'M'.
You think "This is stupid. I'm going to choose a different letter." 
You pick 'T' in the game. It is correct.
You type 'python hanging.py .utt s r n l'
You see the list of all the words and you make your choice.

CASE 2: MAKING A WORD
arg1: The pool of 12 letters given to you by the game, from which you must make your word
arg2: Any letters in the pool of 12 that you want to guarantee are in the words you see (separated by spaces)

Program finds all words that can be made from your letters (optionally incuding only those with the letter(s) you want) and prints them.

EXAMPLE: 
The game gives me the pool of letters 'ABCEDFGHIJKL'. 
I go to the command line and type 'python hanging.py abcdefghijkl'. I see the output

I decide that I want a 'J' to be in my word. 
I type 'python hanging.py abcdefghijkl j' and see
"8 letter words:

NOTES
I have the output printing on a 100 character line. If you want to change that, change the value of 'char_per_line' at the top of hanging.py.
